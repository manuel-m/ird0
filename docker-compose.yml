# Main Docker Compose orchestration file
# This file includes all service groups for the insurance platform
#
# Usage:
#   Start all services:       docker compose up -d
#   Start with rebuild:       docker compose up --build -d
#   Stop all services:        docker compose down
#   View logs:                docker compose logs -f [service-name]
#
# Selective startup (using individual files):
#   Infrastructure only:      docker compose -f docker-compose.infrastructure.yml up -d
#   Infrastructure + Directory: docker compose -f docker-compose.infrastructure.yml -f docker-compose.directory.yml up -d
#   Full stack:               docker compose up -d (uses this file)
#
# File organization:
#   docker-compose.infrastructure.yml - Core infrastructure (postgres, vault, networks, volumes)
#   docker-compose.directory.yml      - Directory microservices (policyholders, experts, providers, insurers)
#   docker-compose.apps.yml           - Application services (incident, notification, sftp-server)
